Not long I got seconded to London where I spend six years working and soaking up the wonderful culture Europe has to offer. Then its on to Canada for another two before another secondment took me back to the US. Salt Lake City is where my family take root and we have been here for almost ten. My next journey continues and this time its the coding world. I love it!!</p>
